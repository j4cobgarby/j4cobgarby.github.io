This one was really fun. We wanted to transmit raw data, but where each bit of an 8-bit byte is transferred in its own weird and quirky way.

One bit was transferred by a camera looking at a rotating flag, and seeing if it's red or green; one by scanning a QR code which can be spun round to show an alternate one; one consisted of a servo motor physically pushing a button; to name a few...

I believe we got data transmitting at _almost_ 3B/s!
