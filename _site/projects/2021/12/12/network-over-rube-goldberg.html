    <p>This one was really fun. We wanted to transmit raw data, but where each bit of an 8-bit byte is transferred in its own weird and quirky way.</p>

<p>One bit was transferred by a camera looking at a rotating flag, and seeing if it’s red or green; one by scanning a QR code which can be spun round to show an alternate one; one consisted of a servo motor physically pushing a button; to name a few…</p>

<p>I believe we got data transmitting at <em>almost</em> 3B/s!</p>
