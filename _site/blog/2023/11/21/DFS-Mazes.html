<h1>Depth-First Search Maze Generation</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>There are quite a few approaches for generating mazes algorithmically. I particularly like
the graph based approaches, since they seem most adaptable. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using a MST algorithm (like Prim’s or Kruskal’s) on a randomly weighted graph.</li>
  <li>Performing a depth-first search on a graph, with some randomness built into the algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe there are even more graph-based maze generation methods, but I don’t know about them.
There are of course some non-graph-based methods, like iteratively splitting a space into
randomised chunks and cutting holes in the new walls<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, or even using cellular automata<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>,
which are also interesting.</p>

<p>The reason I say that graph based approaches are most adaptable is because of their independence
on any particular shape or structure. You’ll see what I mean by this later on.</p>

<h2 id="defining-a-maze">Defining a Maze</h2>

<p>First it might be a good idea to define what a maze is and isn’t. For example, consider this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/maze1.png" alt="A Simple Maze" /></p>

<p>Imagine that the black lines are passageways that you can walk through. This definitely seems
like a maze. Here are some properties of this specific maze:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No loops/cycles: there is exactly one route from any one location to any other.</li>
  <li>There are no disconnected sections: any point is reachable from any other point.</li>
  <li>No obvious-at-a-glance route from a point to another far-ish-away point.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last of these is the most controversial of the three, since it’s very difficult to quantify
how <em>difficult</em> a maze is. However, here are some features of good mazes that probably help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No repeating patterns, as these would make visually parsing the maze more manageable.</li>
  <li>No excessively long straight corridors/lots of bends makes following paths more tricky.</li>
  <li>Many points where passageways branch, meaning that someone solving the maze has to check a lot of different routes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Probably none of these features are <em>necessary</em> for something to be a maze, though. Loops are
definitely possible in mazes, there’s no reason why not, and the only reason they’re not present
in the above maze is because it is specifically a spanning tree of a graph. Mazes may in theory
have disconnected sections, I suppose, but in that case it would really just be two (or more)
mazes next to each other. Also, mazes don’t <em>need</em> to have a non-obvious solution – take the
kids mazes on the backs of some ceral boxes, for example.</p>

<p>In fact, mazes don’t even need to have branches. Some hedge mazes<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, for instance, are just one
long twisting path from start to finish. And should all mazes have a start and a finish? The maze
presented above doesn’t have a specific start or finish, but the nature of it means that any two
points on it can reasonably be chosen for these. I would say that a maze has to have a defined
start and finish, <em>or</em> be constructed such that they can be chosen arbitrarily.</p>

<p>I think a reasonable definition for a maze is just “A passageway (or collection of passageways)
connecting a start to a finish”. Then if our maze has starts and finishes that can be chosen
arbitrarily, we basically have a set of mazes with the same construction but with different
start and finish points. Anyway, this doesn’t matter.</p>

<h2 id="depth-first-search">Depth-First Search</h2>

<p>The maze-generation algorithm I’m going to talk about now is depth-first search (DFS). This algorithm
is used for many more useful purposes than generating mazes, but this is what I’ll use it for.</p>

<p>DFS takes a graph (a collection of nodes and edges between them) and a starting node, and, in a certain 
order, examines each of these. The reason it’s called “depth-first” is that it starts by traversing one
path for as long as possible before going back to try another one. This is in contrast to breadth-first
searching which, before examining any node which is n nodes away from the starting node, examines all
those which are up to n-1 away.</p>

<p>This post isn’t meant to be a detailed depth-first search tutorial – you can easily find those
anywhere on the internet. Even still, here’s some rough pseudocode for one iteration of the algorithm,
as I implemented it for this purpose:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>PROCEDURE dfs_step
INPUTS:
  G: The graph to search
  S: A stack data structure.

WHILE S is not empty
  next = S.pop()

  IF `next` has not yet been visited:
    Visit `next`

    FOR EACH edge IN `next`'s neighbours:
      S.push(`edge`)

    RETURN
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is slightly different to standard iterative DFS implementations, in that the procedure only
executes one <em>step</em>, by which I mean it runs until it either exhausts the stack or a new node is
visited. Normal implementations run until the entire graph has been visited.</p>

<p>The reason for this difference is that I wanted to display a realtime animation of the algorithm
running, and this implementation allows me to periodically run a step (say, every half a second)
and update the graphical representation accordingly, without the algorithm itself needing to know
anything about this.</p>

<p>To summarise the pseudocode, we repeatedly pop nodes from the stack until we find one that we
haven’t visited yet. Then, we “visit” it, push all of its neighbours to the stack, and <em>return</em>,
i.e. end the procedure. A traditional DFS implementation won’t return at this point, as I mentioned
earlier, and instead will repeat until there’s nothing left on the stack.</p>

<p>The meaning of “visiting” a node depends on what the DFS is meant to achieve. For example, another
use of DFS is finding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_(graph_theory)#Algorithms">connected components</a>
within a graph. To do this, we can just begin a DFS at an arbitrary node, and efficiently find
the connected component that contains it, then repeating the process on an unclassified node. In such a case, “visiting” a node would be adding it to a list of nodes in some structure
representing the connected components of a graph.</p>

<p>What about generating a maze, though? If we run DFS on any graph and make a note of the order in which
nodes are visited, we can construct a tree containing every node. Let’s run through a quick example.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/dfstree1.png" alt="The graph" />
<img src="/assets/img/dfstree2.png" alt="DFS intermediate" />
<img src="/assets/img/dfstree3.png" alt="DFS finished" /></p>

<p>The first image shows the plain graph which we’ll operate on. I generated this graph by randomly
placing 20 nodes in a 500×500 unit space, and mutually connecting any two nodes which are closer
than (or exactly) 150 units apart. The second image visualises the very first iteration of my DFS
step procedure. It’s starting at the top-left node, where the orange and green lines are protruding
from, which represent all of the node under consideration’s neighbours. The actual implementation
pushes the edges such that the <em>closest</em> edge is at the <em>top</em> of the stack.</p>

<p>In the third image, in bold, the resulting spanning tree is shown. It may not look <em>much</em> like a
maze at this point, but the point is we can run this on any graph, and certain graphs will yield
better mazes. In fact, the big square maze presented earlier in this post was generated in the
exact same way as this tree. The primary difference between these two, and all the other mazes
I’ll make, are in the way the graph is generated initially, although I make a couple of extra
modifications to the algorithm as well, for some.</p>

<h2 id="grid-like-maze">Grid-like Maze</h2>

<p>A very standard type of maze is square-shaped, with horizontal and vertical passageways. I can
very easily write a function to place nodes in a square grid, and join them to their correct neighbours.
Then I can just feed this graph into the DFS algorithm, and…</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/boringgrid.png" alt="Boring Grid Maze" /></p>

<p>Oh, it’s not a very good maze. Going back to my thoughts earlier about what makes a (good) maze,
we can see that this one has no cycles and no disconnected sections, like the earlier maze, <em>but</em>,
it’s very easy to solve this maze from any point A to any point B. In fact it’s trivial, because
this maze has no branches at all – it’s topologically equivalent to a straight line. Starting from
A, you can always get to B, regardless of where B is, by just trying each of the two opposite directions.
In fact this maze is <em>even</em> worse than just the general case of mazes topologically equivalent to
straight lines, because it has a consistent repeating zig-zag pattern going downwards, so if you
know the positions of A and B you can immediately know whether you have to travel up or down in space,
and hence work out if you need to start moving left or right. In other words, with this maze, it
would be possible to implement a function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Node next_node(Node current_node, Node to_find)</code> that
runs in O(1) time, given that we can view the structure of the maze from above.</p>

<p>The reason that our algorithm generates a zig-zag maze here is just because we don’t involve any
randomness yet. The procedural method by which we generated our graph appends neighbouring nodes
to a list contained within each node, and this list is iterated in order when pushing to the stack
in the DFS algorithm. The way that this list is generated means that neighbours are pushed in the
order (up, down, left, right), and so if a right-facing neighbour <em>is</em> present, this will always
be preferred (because it will be at the top of the stack at the start of the next iteration). This
explains the intial long-as-possible right-facing path. It only stops moving right when it can’t
anymore, because that neighbour is then not pushed to the stack.</p>

<p>The solution is simple though, we can just shuffle each node’s neighbour list at initialisation
time. And this pattern has the added benefit that it’s adaptable to different patterns that we
might want. For example, remember what I mentioned earlier about picking the neighbour closest
to the current node, when we saw the DFS algorithm running on a more freeform graph layout? Well
that behaviour doesn’t have to be impemented within DFS at all, keeping it more generalised.
Instead we implement that in the same way as this neighbour shuffling, by <em>sorting</em> each node’s
neighbours list by distance, specifically for graphs where we want this shortest-first behaviour.</p>

<p>Anyway, if we implement this neighbour shuffling, we get this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/goodgrid.png" alt="Better grid" /></p>

<p>This is significantly better. Now, we have <em>lots</em> of branching – this occurs when a search
path gets to a point where it cannot go any deeper, so it pushes no neighbours for the next
iteration and instead some neighbours that were pushed by an earlier iteration are taken
instead.</p>

<p>This maze still isn’t ideal though. The branches, although many, are not, on average, very
deep, which makes it easy to quickly disregard many of them when solving the maze. I think
this is just because this particular maze is fairly small. If I generate a larger one, the
branches become far longer.</p>

<h2 id="customising-the-maze">Customising The Maze</h2>

<p>It can be fun to fiddle with the code a bit to get some different interesting mazes. With our
graph-based maze approach, there are a lot of options here, because we simply apply our algorithm
to any graph.</p>
