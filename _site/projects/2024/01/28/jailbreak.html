    <p>A fun little game where you, a prisoner, have to convince a lunch lady to give you nicer food, and a warden to let you out of your cell.</p>

<p>Since it’s 2024, we used the ChatGPT API to “script” these characters on the fly. It’s pretty easy to convince the lunch lady to give you the lovely “crunchy brown bombles” (and in fact, you can even get her to help you write Python code, if you ask nicely enough), but it’s extremely difficult to convince the warden to let you out of prison.</p>
