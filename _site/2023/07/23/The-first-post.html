<h1>The First Post</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>Hello! After spending a couple of days messing with CSS and working out how to use Jekyll, I’ve got this website running.</p>

<p>I plan on posting about anything I happen to find interesting, which will hopefully in the near future consist of working out the design for a kernel I’m going to make. I also have a firefox bookmark folder full of some interesting and cool papers I found, which I plan to write a bit about.</p>

<p>On a different note, I also plan to upload some recipes to this website – some of my own, and some that are not my own – in large for my benefit (so that I can easily find them and not forget them wherever I am), but of course feel free to have a look at those. In that same section of my site, I’ll also put some other random stuff, if it comes up.</p>

<p>Hopefully this website will be an enjoyable experience.</p>
