 - Chess move generalisation, for chess game
 - Buddy allocator
 - Some teas I like
 - Some recommendations for getting into OS development; off the top of my head, at least mention:
   - Really good to start with writing via serial port -- what's the point in implementing a text mode driver early on?
   - To implement bootloader or use an existing one?
   - Which language to use? I always use C, but tbh probably not best
 - Card game description -> implementation "compiler"
