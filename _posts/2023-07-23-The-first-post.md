Hello! After spending a couple of days messing with CSS and working out how to use Jekyll, I've got this website running.

I plan on posting about anything I happen to find interesting, which will hopefully in the near future consist of working out the design for a kernel I'm going to make. I also have a firefox bookmark folder full of some interesting and cool papers I found, which I plan to write a bit about.

Hopefully this website will be an enjoyable experience.
