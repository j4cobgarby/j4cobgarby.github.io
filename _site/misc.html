            Hello, welcome to my website! I'm Jacob, and at the moment I'm a <b>PhD student</b> at Chalmers University, Gothenburg, doing <a href="https://github.com/j4cobgarby/"><b>computer things</b></a>. In particular, I'm trying to speed up various algorithms (SGD, graph algorithms, etc.) with custom runtime systems! &#8230;

            </ul>
            <hr>
            <p>
            &#8230; Aside from that, I also like low level software development (like <a href="https://github.com/j4cobgarby/fors-kernel"><b>operating systems</b></a> and microcontroller programming), graphics programming (visualisations, games, etc.), and network protocols and distributed systems.
            </p><p>
            I also really enjoy going to <a href="/projects.html#hackathons" alt="See my hackathon projects!"><b>hackathons</b></a> (events where you spend 24 hours, with a team, to make whatever project you want). According to <a href="https://devpost.com/j4cobgarby">Devpost</a>, I've been to nine of these (but it's missing at least one). Of all these, my friends and I have won first place three times! They're very fun, you should definitely go if you have the chance.
            </p><p>
            But anyway, there are also some things that I do which don't even involve computers at all! I play <a href="https://lichess.org/@/j4cobgarby">chess</a> a lot, enjoy mechanical keyboards (okay, that one is computer related), really like <a href="/teas.html">tea</a>, enjoy cooking and electronics, and play guitar.
            </p>
